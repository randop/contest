Programming test for Reindeer

Using cakePHP (either 1.3 or 2.0 - we have been using 1.3 for the vast majority of our projects, even though 2.0 has been released) - create a simple web application.

Outline of the app:
	The application needs to be a very simple contest creation and entry applications.  
	You need to be able to create a contest, edit it and have a user be able to enter it. 
	Creating a database is required to save the application data.

Requirements:
	- The contest should have a name, a description, and a created_on date.
	- The entry needs to contain the entrant's name, entry date, and be associated with whatever contest that it's an entry for.
	- We will need an export/dump of the database that you create.
	
Bonus points:
	- Once the application is built, any styling that isn't the default cakePHP styling
	- Make the contest administration (creation, editing, etc...) password protected - all using the cakePHP admin conventions.
